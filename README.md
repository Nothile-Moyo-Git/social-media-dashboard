## Overview:
This app is a Social Media Dashboard with a dark/light toggle.
It uses your operating systems default color theme as the default, and can be swapped at will.

## Configuration:
This app was built using React.js and TailwindCSS. 
It's purpose was to get an understanding of TailwindCSS, installing it through the CLI. Dealing with module exports for custom styling, looking into @apply to create block-level css classes, and bundling/deployments. 

You should be able to simply run "npm install" to install all necessary dependencies.

## Version control:
The master branch is the main branch. The project-docs folder is for frontendmentor.
This app is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be found here: https://nothile-moyo-git.github.io/social-media-dashboard/
